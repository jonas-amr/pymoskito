The __init__ File
---------------------

The second file should be an initializing file called::

    __init__.py

Every additional file containg modules you create needs to be registered 
in this document, so it will be loaded
when starting PyMoskito. To register a new file called FILE_NAME.py,
add the following line to __init__.py::

    from . import FILE_NAME

We will shortly  create a file named model.
Add this line to register it:

.. literalinclude:: ../../pymoskito/examples/ballbeam/__init__.py
    :lineno-match:
